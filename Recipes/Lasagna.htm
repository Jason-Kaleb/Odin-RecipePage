        <h2>Description:</h2> 

         <p>Some recipes take a little more time to make but are so worth the effort — like lasagna. This versatile Italian dish can be labor-intensive, but the prep is worth it for the delicious final product. (It's no wonder Garfield the cat loved them so much.) Allrecipes has hundreds of lasagna recipes to choose from, but we've rounded up our 15 best lasagna recipes of all time. Scroll through to find recipes for artichoke spinach lasagna, creamy chicken lasagna, eggplant lasagna, and more lasagnas that you'll never get tired of.</p>
         <p>This unique lasagna is filled with artichokes and spinach and topped with crumbled herb and garlic feta cheese. Reviewers say you don't need to boil your lasagna noodles before cooking, instead, you can use no-boil noodles or dry noodles that will soften from the hot sauce. "I made this for an ultra-picky friend once, and need to make it again soon. It's a GREAT variation on the typical meat lasagna. My only changes were to use a homemade sauce, and I never boil my noodles first," says home cook Zanne. </p>

             <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
             <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
             <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
             <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
             <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
             <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
             <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
             <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
             <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
             <li>1 egg</li>
             <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
             <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>Steps:</h2>

         <ol>
            <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
            <br>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving. </li>
