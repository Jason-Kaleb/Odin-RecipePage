        <p>If you can make boxed macaroni and cheese, you can make this one-pan, scratch-made mac and cheese! The bacon, chives, and crispy bread crumb topping add some great extra flavor and texture.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>¼ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>¼ cup real bacon bits</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon snipped chives</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stove top over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and bacon bits. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Top with chives and serve immediately.</li>
            <br>
        </ol>
